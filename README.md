## Overview

MySPIM is a mini processor simulator designed to replicate the functions of a MIPS single-cycle processor. Developed in C, the simulator processes MIPS machine code step-by-step, demonstrating the principles of datapath operations and control signals in a single-cycle architecture.

The project was completed as part of the CDA3103 â€“ Computer Logic and Organization course and adheres to the provided guidelines for implementing key functionalities of the MIPS processor.
